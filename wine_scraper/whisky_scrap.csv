Game of Thrones Six Kingdoms";4;['1'];['84.95'];['121.36'];Special Offer;The ninth release in Diageo's Game of Thrones Collection, Six Kingdoms is a 15-year-old Mortlach single malt, matured in a combination of first-fill oloroso sherry and ex-bourbon casks.
"Clynelish Reserve
Game of Thrones House Tyrell";None;['5'];['49.75'];['71.07'];Summer Sale B;"House Tyrell of Highgarden, rulers of the Reach, are used to lush green scenery, echoed in the green pastures and rolling hills surrounding Clynelish Distillery. A House known best for their wealth and their emblem – the golden rose – the Tyrells are a proud and noble family, and like the golden rose are hiding thorns beneath their petals. Clynelish Reserve has a sweet and fruity flavor, with a spicy undercurrent, just enough to prove it still has bite. Made with water said to come from Clynemilton burn where the water runs over veins of gold in the rock, this single malt is light and floral like Highgarden, but should not be underestimated as it still holds a strong Highland character.


This light-gold Scotch initially offers fresh fruit flavours - such as mango and pineapple - before slipping into rich, sweet vanilla notes. It finishes with sweet, maritime notes that mingle with the light floral flavours which warm and build throughout, leaving the signature sweet Clynelish waxiness behind.

"Glen Garioch 1975
Jean Boyer";None;None;[];[];FREE UK Mainl;A fascinating independent bottling of a malt little known in the mainstream but treasured by connoisseurs. This expression, from 1975, is one of the few remaining old-school Glen Gariochs, meaning that it is very noticeably more peaty than modern distillery expressions. The whisky was originally bottled in 1990, but the stock was forgotten about and so it has only recently been released with new packaging.

Bottled in February 2020, aromas of sweet biscuits, smoked cedar and Manuka honey mingle with pipe tobacco, old leather, candle wax and hints on vanilla on the nose. The palate offers notes of burnt oak, barbecued marshmallow, toffee, sea salt and Belgian caramel waffles, as well as roasted coffee beans, sticky toffee pudding and white pepper, wrapped in waves of peat smoke.
Laphroaig 15 Year Old;None;['19'];[];['464.29'];FREE UK Mainl;Zesty oak and warm peat smoke top notes, with sweet undertones, reminiscent of fresh nutmeg and toasted almonds. Faintly salty. Laphroaig 15yo is a smoother and more elegant elder sibling to the robust 10 year-old.

"Benrinnes 15 Year Old
Flora & Fauna";None;['10'];['51.95'];['74.21'];Summer Sale B;A very interesting dram, the only Speysider to be triple-distilled like a Lowland malt or Irish whiskey, but with a lot more body and character than either of those styles. Impressive stuff.
Bruichladdich 1970;None;['2'];[];['357.14'];FREE UK Mainl;A 2002 distillery bottling of 1970 Bruichladdich matured for about 31 years. This has gone down as one of the best Bruichladdichs in modern memory - a 95 from Whisky Fun's Serge Valentin (and listed as his favourite expression from the distillery), a pile of superlatives in posts across the internet and a quick 'Amazing!!' when we just mentioned it on Twitter.
Glen Elgin 12 Year Old;None;['11'];['39.95'];['57.07'];Summer Sale B;Glen Elgin 12yo is a top-quality malt, highly sought-after for blends. This is a little-seen single malt expression that represents great value for money.

30 Year Old 2nd Edition";None;None;[];['142.86'];FREE UK Mainl;The second of the three extraordinary Oloroso cask 1964 Bowmores released in the mid-1990s. Like the first batch, this release was of 2000 bottles, and originally retailed on the high street for around £80(!). A much higher proportion of casks filled in the 1960s were sherry, and Black Bowmore is proof of the quality of some of those casks. With an almost unfathomable concentration and intensity of flavour, and perfect balance of fruit, peat and power, this whisky deserves the frequently overused 'legendary' tag and has assumed almost mythic status amongst whisky collectors and aficionados.
Auchentoshan Three Wood;None;['71'];['48.75'];['69.64'];Summer Sale B;"The ever-popular Auchentoshan 3 Wood is matured initially in bourbon casks before being finished in Oloroso then Pedro Ximénez casks for an extra layer of rich, sweet fruitiness.

These two distinctive spirits, combined with a small amount of whisky aged in new toasted oak, were married for around four months before bottling, and the result is a finely balanced and richly fruity single malt that will surprise those sceptical about the cask combination.


The 1991 Grand Vintage is part of Glenmorangie’s Bond House No.1 Collection, a series of vintage whiskies that celebrates the largest of the distillery’s traditional 19th century warehouses. Bonded Warehouse No.1 was transformed into Glenmorangie’s impressive new still house in 1990.

The strength of will and fierce, unwavering determination of House Targaryen allowed Daenerys Targaryen to walk through fire and emerge at the head of the greatest army the known world has ever seen. Under the Targaryen banner she marched to claim the Iron Throne and bend her rivals to her will. The same fiery spirit and steely resolve fueled Helen Cumming and her daughter-in-law Elizabeth as they formed Cardhu Distillery in the male-dominated whisky world. This single malt celebrates legendary women, in the Seven Kingdoms and in Scotland, with a drink that is rich in flavour, dark and fruity with a spicy toffee edge.


The whisky's rich golden colour is accompanied by soft honey aromas with just a hint of toasted oak. Take a sip and you’re greeted by apple pie flavours, sweet baked fruit and buttery cinnamon, which quickly develop into a rich caramel with clove and malty biscuit flavours mixed throughout.

Suntory Hakushu 18 Year Old;None;['9'];[];['857.14'];FREE UK Mainl;"A massive step up in quality from the standard Hakushu 12 yrs, this 18yo is amazingly well-defined (as we've come to expect from Japanese whisky) with deliciously rounded fruit and cereal flavours, at times surprisingly reminiscent of the finest Irish potstill whisky (eg Redbreast 15yo).

Amrut Fusion;None;['75'];['55.45'];['79.21'];None;"Amrut Fusion gets its name from the fact that it uses two barleys: Indian and Scottish - with the latter being peated for good measure.

"Balvenie 17 Year Old
Peated Cask";None;['6'];[];['642.86'];FREE UK Mainl;The 2010 release of Balvenie 17yo is a bit of a curio, having been re-racked after inital normal maturation into casks that previously held...a peated Balvenie?! So this is a peated finish rather than a peated whisky. The smoke is there, but not as full-frontal as you'd get if the spirit itself was peated. A very interesting experiment, and we await the peated Balvenie that previously graced the casks with eager interest.
Maker's 46 Bourbon Sample;None;['11'];['4.95'];['16.50'];None;Maker's 46 is a higher strength release from Maker's Mark. Partly matured in barrels with new French-oak staves, which adds extra spice, sweetness and vanilla notes.
Woodford Reserve Masters No.10 White Corn;None;None;[];['185.71'];FREE UK Mainl;The 10th edition in Woodford Reserve's Master's Collection is made using white corn, rather than the usual yellow.

Knob Creek Rye Sample;None;['2'];['5.25'];['17.50'];None;A Perfect Measure sample bottle of Knob Creek Rye. Not as spicy as many ryes, this is a great in-between release, sitting between a high-rye bourbon and a pure rye to give the best of both worlds
The Gospel Straight Rye;None;None;['49.95'];['71.36'];None;An Australian straight rye whiskey from The Gospel, made using single-source grain from near Melbourne. Aromas of buttery rye bread, toffee, vanilla and white pepper fill the nose, complemented by notes of clove, pepper, green apple and caramel throughout the palate.
"Glamis 10 Year Old
Glenfyne Distillery Bot.1930s";None;None;[];[];FREE UK Mainl;An extraordinary find, this is one of the rarest single malts we've ever come across. Glamis is the single malt from the long-extinct Glenfyne distillery (sometimes also known as Glendarroch), which was situated in Ardrishaig on the edge of Loch Fyne and closed in 1937.
"Wilderness Trail 6 Year
Old Bond Single Barrel Bourbon";None;None;['90.95'];['121.27'];None;A single barrel bourbon from Wilderness Trail, made with a mash bill of 64% corn, 24% rye and 12% malted barley and matured in a single heavily charred barrel.

"Glenlivet 12 Year Old
Bot.1960s";None;None;[];[];FREE UK Mainl;An old bottling of 12 year old Glenlivet, consistently amongst the top selling Scotch whisky brands in the world. We estimate this was bottled in the 1960s, a decade which saw the distillery lead the way, both in becoming the first whisky to be marketed as a single malt and the first Scotch distillery to open a visitor's centre.
"Ardbeggeddon 1972
29 Year Old Old Malt Cask";None;['1'];[];[];FREE UK Mainl;"A very special Ardbeg 1972, bottled from a single sherry cask to commemorate the Plowed Society's Ardbegeddon gathering in Las Vegas in 2002. A legendary bottling that won huge critical acclaim on release and remains highly sought-after.

"Benrinnes 1996
12 Year Old Managers' Choice";None;None;[];['427.14'];FREE UK Mainl;Benrinnes is another Diageo distillery of which very little is seen. Most of the malt produced at Benrinnes is used as blend fodder, so it's great to see a debut single cask bottling to sit alongside the Flora & Fauna version and 2009's acclaimed Special Release 23yo.
"Springbank 1966
Local Barley Cask #507";None;None;[];['285.72'];FREE UK Mainl;"Another of Springbank's legendary full strength Local Barley single cask bottlings from 1966. This one picked up a humungous 94 points from Whiskyfun's Serge Valentin.

Nikka Miyagikyo Sample;None;['9'];['7.25'];['24.17'];None;The trademark note in Nikka’s Miyagikyo whisky is an elegant fruitiness. This is the ideal introduction to Japanese whisky, and is a moreish dram loaded with red-berry fruitiness.

"Longrow 14 Year Old
Bot.1980s";None;None;[];['333.33'];FREE UK Mainl;This rare Longrow from the 1980's does not come up very often. We believe only a small batch was done which was sold only through the Cadenheads shop in Edinburgh.
"Brenne Estate Cask French Single Malt
Cognac Finish";None;['3'];['55.75'];['79.64'];None;An unusual dram from France, twice distilled in the copper alembic stills normally used in Cognac production. The Cognac theme is further continued in the whisky's aging process, as after a period of maturation in new Limousin oak barrels it is then finished in Cognac casks. The result is a single malt with intense notes of apricot, banana, rose, vanilla and bubblegum. One for those with a sweeter tooth.
Rampur Asava;None;['4'];['64.95'];['92.79'];None;"An Indian single malt from Rampur, distilled in the picturesque foothills of the Himalayas and matured in a combination of ex-bourbon casks and ex-Cabernet Sauvignon casks.

A vatting of two casks from different years that both bore the number 1759 (the year of Burns' birth), this comes in an unusually pretty decanter with an insert containing a map and a Burns poem as well as information about the bottling.
Dalmore - Candela 50 Year Old;None;['5'];[];['857.14'];FREE UK Mainl;"""Candela is the international unit for the measurement of the intensity of light. It defines brilliance.

"Angel's Envy Bourbon Sample
Port Finish";None;['28'];['5.95'];['19.83'];None;A Perfect Measure sample bottle of Angel's Envy, an interesting bourbon with a unique twist - after the initial maturation it takes a leaf out of Scotch Whisky's book and spends between 3 and 6 months finishing in port barrels. The more experimentation the better, we reckon, especially when it turns out something like this - marrying the sweet caramel and grain of bourbon with the rich sticky wine flavours of a port cask.

"Macallan 1947
15 Year Old Fine & Rare";None;None;[];['428.57'];FREE UK Mainl;Something of an oddity, here - this Macallan 1947 was originally bottled for Italy in 1962 as a fifteen year-old, before being repackaged for the Fine and Rare range. This is likely to be more peaty than today's Macallan, as the distillery was forced to use peat in the kilns for a few years during and after WWII because of the scarcity and high price of coal.

"Springbank 50 Year Old
Bot.1960s";None;None;[];[];FREE UK Mainl;A real treasure. The malt in this bottle was distilled in 1919 and bottled in 1969, which shows how far ahead of their time the Mitchell family company were. This malt resembles very closely the whisky bottled as Campbeltown 1919, of which only 24 bottles were released. Campbeltown 1919 costs around £50,000 (if you can find it), making this a relative bargain.

Scapa 14 Year Old;None;['10'];[];['357.14'];FREE UK Mainl;From a tiny distillery in Orkney, Scapa is often overlooked in favour of its more famous neighbour Highland Park.

"Port Ellen 1978
24 Year Old 2nd Release (2002)";None;None;[];['857.14'];FREE UK Mainl;The first Port Ellen Annual Release goes for much more these days, but for many people (including at least one TWE staff member) the second release, bottled at 59.35% in 2002, remains at the top of the pile for official PE.

"Macallan 1946
Select Reserve 52 Year Old";None;['6'];[];['285.71'];FREE UK Mainl;This Macallan 1946 is rather unusual, in that it was made with peated malt due to the high post-war prices of coal.

Only a handful of bottlings have ever been released, of which this is perhaps the most interesting. Having bottled what was believed to be the last casks of Ben Wyvis in 1999 under the name 'The Final Resurrection', Whyte & Mackay were somewhat taken aback to discover that one more cask did in fact exist in their warehouses. Unfortunately it belonged to someone else, but the twist came when it was discovered that the owner had defaulted on their storage fees. The cask was therefore repossessed and this is the bottling that resulted - probably the very last bottling from one of the shortest-lived distilleries in Scotland. A true collector's item.

"Benromach 1949
55 Year Old";None;None;[];['142.86'];FREE UK Mainl;"Very few malts can stand anything like as much ageing as this Benromach has managed. Which makes it all the more amazing that the whisky inside the bottle can still seem so fresh. Of course, over fifty-five years, the angels get to take more than their fair share - only eighty-three bottles were yielded from the cask - but what remains is a fantastic concentration of flavour and an almost eerie youthfulness.

Nikka Yoichi Single Malt;None;['8'];['74.95'];['107.07'];None;"Relaunched in 2016, this comes from Nikka's excellent Yoichi distillery. This is a blend of single malts from different years and consequently does not carry an age statement. This is a smoky whisky with a maritime character.

"Bowmore 1968
31 Year Old Millennium Edition Cask #3817 Signatory";None;None;[];['714.29'];FREE UK Mainl;A 1968 vintage bottling of Bowmore from independent bottlers Signatory. The distillery was purchased by Stanley P. Morrison (later to become Morrison Bowmore) in 1963 and there are many bottlings distilled in the latter part of the decade that are simply stunning.

Buffalo Trace Bourbon;None;['73'];['25.95'];['37.07'];None;Buffalo Trace is a really classy bourbon from the eponymous distillery that has been responsible for some truly outstanding products in recent years. A must-stock for any bar worthy of the name and probably the best all-rounder at the price

Jack Daniel's Single Barrel Select;None;['114'];['43.95'];['62.79'];None;"Single Barrel Select is the logical next step for any fan of the signature Jack Daniels flavour profile. With its higher ABV of 45% (90 proof) you’ll experience those classic caramel, oak-spice and fruity sweetness in higher definition, with a slight increase in punch that’s sure to hold your attention.


With each batch drawn from a single barrel of Jack Daniels, Single Barrel Select is a particularly pure expression of a whisky adored all over the world – a must-try for JD enthusiasts and, indeed, American whiskey fans at large.

It's also got some mizunara (Japanese oak) matured whisky in the mix, which comes through as a complex spicy and almost incense-like note. A well put together and deep dram.

Tasting Notes (1)"
"Angel's Envy Bourbon
Port Finish";None;['28'];['56.95'];['81.36'];None;An interesting bourbon with a unique twist - after the initial maturation it takes a leaf out of Scotch Whisky's book and spends between 3 and 6 months finishing in port barrels. The more experimentation the better, we reckon, especially when it turns out something like this - marrying the sweet caramel and grain of bourbon with the rich sticky wine flavours of a port cask.
Eagle Rare 10 Year Old;None;['43'];['38.95'];['55.64'];None;A top-quality bourbon from Buffalo Trace, the Eagle Rare 10yo is deliciously fragrant and woody, and has to be one of the best bargains available in this price range.

Game of Thrones House Tyrell";None;['5'];['49.75'];['71.07'];Summer Sale B;"House Tyrell of Highgarden, rulers of the Reach, are used to lush green scenery, echoed in the green pastures and rolling hills surrounding Clynelish Distillery. A House known best for their wealth and their emblem – the golden rose – the Tyrells are a proud and noble family, and like the golden rose are hiding thorns beneath their petals. Clynelish Reserve has a sweet and fruity flavor, with a spicy undercurrent, just enough to prove it still has bite. Made with water said to come from Clynemilton burn where the water runs over veins of gold in the rock, this single malt is light and floral like Highgarden, but should not be underestimated as it still holds a strong Highland character.


This light-gold Scotch initially offers fresh fruit flavours - such as mango and pineapple - before slipping into rich, sweet vanilla notes. It finishes with sweet, maritime notes that mingle with the light floral flavours which warm and build throughout, leaving the signature sweet Clynelish waxiness behind.

This light-gold Scotch initially offers fresh fruit flavours - such as mango and pineapple - before slipping into rich, sweet vanilla notes. It finishes with sweet, maritime notes that mingle with the light floral flavours which warm and build throughout, leaving the signature sweet Clynelish waxiness behind.

Game of Thrones House Tyrell";None;['5'];['49.75'];['71.07'];Summer Sale B;"House Tyrell of Highgarden, rulers of the Reach, are used to lush green scenery, echoed in the green pastures and rolling hills surrounding Clynelish Distillery. A House known best for their wealth and their emblem – the golden rose – the Tyrells are a proud and noble family, and like the golden rose are hiding thorns beneath their petals. Clynelish Reserve has a sweet and fruity flavor, with a spicy undercurrent, just enough to prove it still has bite.

This light-gold Scotch initially offers fresh fruit flavours - such as mango and pineapple - before slipping into rich, sweet vanilla notes. It finishes with sweet, maritime notes that mingle with the light floral flavours which warm and build throughout, leaving the signature sweet Clynelish waxiness behind.

Clynelish Reserve has a sweet and fruity flavor, with a spicy undercurrent, just enough to prove it still has bite.

This light-gold Scotch initially offers fresh fruit flavours - such as mango and pineapple - before slipping into rich, sweet vanilla notes. It finishes with sweet, maritime notes that mingle with the light floral flavours which warm and build throughout, leaving the signature sweet Clynelish waxiness behind.

Game of Thrones House Tyrell";None;['5'];['49.75'];['71.07'];Summer Sale B;"House Tyrell of Highgarden, rulers of the Reach, are used to lush green scenery, echoed in the green pastures and rolling hills surrounding Clynelish Distillery. A House known best for their wealth and their emblem – the golden rose – the Tyrells are a proud and noble family, and like the golden rose are hiding thorns beneath their petals. Clynelish Reserve has a sweet and fruity flavor, with a spicy undercurrent, just enough to prove it still has bite. Made with water said to come from Clynemilton burn where the water runs over veins of gold in the rock, this single malt is light and floral like Highgarden, but should not be underestimated as it still holds a strong Highland character.


This light-gold Scotch initially offers fresh fruit flavours - such as mango and pineapple - before slipping into rich, sweet vanilla notes. It finishes with sweet, maritime notes that mingle with the light floral flavours which warm and build throughout, leaving the signature sweet Clynelish waxiness behind.

Game of Thrones House Tyrell";None;['5'];['49.75'];['71.07'];Summer Sale B;"House Tyrell of Highgarden, rulers of the Reach, are used to lush green scenery, echoed in the green pastures and rolling hills surrounding Clynelish Distillery. A House known best for their wealth and their emblem – the golden rose – the Tyrells are a proud and noble family, and like the golden rose are hiding thorns beneath their petals. Clynelish Reserve has a sweet and fruity flavor, with a spicy undercurrent, just enough to prove it still has bite. Made with water said to come from Clynemilton burn where the water runs over veins of gold in the rock, this single malt is light and floral like Highgarden, but should not be underestimated as it still holds a strong Highland character.


This light-gold Scotch initially offers fresh fruit flavours - such as mango and pineapple - before slipping into rich, sweet vanilla notes. It finishes with sweet, maritime notes that mingle with the light floral flavours which warm and build throughout, leaving the signature sweet Clynelish waxiness behind.

A House known best for their wealth and their emblem – the golden rose – the Tyrells are a proud and noble family, and like the golden rose are hiding thorns beneath their petals. Clynelish Reserve has a sweet and fruity flavor, with a spicy undercurrent, just enough to prove it still has bite. Made with water said to come from Clynemilton burn where the water runs over veins of gold in the rock, this single malt is light and floral like Highgarden, but should not be underestimated as it still holds a strong Highland character.


This light-gold Scotch initially offers fresh fruit flavours - such as mango and pineapple - before slipping into rich, sweet vanilla notes. It finishes with sweet, maritime notes that mingle with the light floral flavours which warm and build throughout, leaving the signature sweet Clynelish waxiness behind.

A House known best for their wealth and their emblem – the golden rose – the Tyrells are a proud and noble family, and like the golden rose are hiding thorns beneath their petals. Clynelish Reserve has a sweet and fruity flavor, with a spicy undercurrent, just enough to prove it still has bite.

This light-gold Scotch initially offers fresh fruit flavours - such as mango and pineapple - before slipping into rich, sweet vanilla notes.

Clynelish Reserve has a sweet and fruity flavor, with a spicy undercurrent, just enough to prove it still has bite.

This light-gold Scotch initially offers fresh fruit flavours - such as mango and pineapple - before slipping into rich, sweet vanilla notes.

Clynelish Reserve has a sweet and fruity flavor, with a spicy undercurrent, just enough to prove it still has bite. Made with water said to come from Clynemilton burn where the water runs over veins of gold in the rock, this single malt is light and floral like Highgarden, but should not be underestimated as it still holds a strong Highland character.


This light-gold Scotch initially offers fresh fruit flavours - such as mango and pineapple - before slipping into rich, sweet vanilla notes. It finishes with sweet, maritime notes that mingle with the light floral flavours which warm and build throughout, leaving the signature sweet Clynelish waxiness behind.

A House known best for their wealth and their emblem – the golden rose – the Tyrells are a proud and noble family, and like the golden rose are hiding thorns beneath their petals. Clynelish Reserve has a sweet and fruity flavor, with a spicy undercurrent, just enough to prove it still has bite.

This light-gold Scotch initially offers fresh fruit flavours - such as mango and pineapple - before slipping into rich, sweet vanilla notes. It finishes with sweet, maritime notes that mingle with the light floral flavours which warm and build throughout, leaving the signature sweet Clynelish waxiness behind.
